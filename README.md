# BallotAPI - Ballots for developers

**NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE API DOES NOT WORK YET.**

Main website: https://ballotapi.org/

## What is BallotAPI?
BallotAPI exactly what it sounds like: a ballot API. More specifically,
it is a public domain database and REST API of election and ballot
information in the United States. The goal of this project is to allow
developers to integrate up-to-date election and ballot information into their
apps and websites.

This project is maintained by [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org),
a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) brigade.

## Current Status
* [x] Docs - what the API should do ([see project](https://github.com/open-austin/ballotapi/projects/3)) **(Initial docs done! https://ballotapi.org/docs)**
* [ ] Prototype - server that follows the docs ([see project](https://github.com/open-austin/ballotapi/projects/1))
* [x] Website - website design/logo/content ([see project](https://github.com/open-austin/ballotapi/projects/2)) **(New website done! https://ballotapi.org)**
* [ ] Demo - example app that uses the API
* [ ] Testing - automated tests and sanity checks
* [ ] Maintenance - apps for maintaining the dataset
* [ ] Ops - tools for running/monitoring production
